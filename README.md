# Wizeline Data Program Cookbook

This repo contains the knowledge and field experience of the Data Practice @ Wizeline. We aim for this repo to become the common thread for every Wizeliner.

The main goal is to provide a single source of knowledge where best practices, templates, snippets can be shared across our different projects and challenges.
